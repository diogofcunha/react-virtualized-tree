## Introduction
**react-virtualized-tree** is a tree view react library built on top of [react-virtualized](https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/#/components/List)

Its main goal is to display tree like data in a beautiful and fast way. Being a reactive library it uses children functions to achieve maximum extensibility. The core idea behind it is that anyone using it is enable to create a tree as they intent just by rendering their own components or components exported by the tree.

Demo and docs can be found [in here](https://diogofcunha.github.io/react-virtualized-tree/#/examples/basic-tree).

## Installation
You can install via npm or yarn.
`npm i react-virtualized-tree --save` 

or

`yarn add react-virtualized-tree`

To get the basic styles for free you need to import react-virtualized styles only once.
```
import 'react-virtualized/styles.css'
import 'react-virtualized-tree/lib/main.css'
```

If you want to use the icons in the default renderers do the same for material icons.

`import 'material-icons/css/material-icons.css'`

## Usage

To use the standalone tree

`import Tree from 'react-virtualized-tree'`

`import { FilteringContainer } from 'react-virtualized-tree'`


## Dependencies
Most react-virtualized-tree Dependencies are managed internally, the only required peerDependencies are **react**, **react-dom** and **react-virtualized**.
